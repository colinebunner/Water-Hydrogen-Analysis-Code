This is simulation analysis code written by Colin Bunner for a paper
on supercritical phase separations in water/hydrogen mixtures. This 
might be updated with a DOI later when the paper is published.

Notes:

- The Fortran subroutines are not complete programs, but rather analyze
  single frames and were wrapped into Python codes using f2py. Histogram
  normalization that can be done once on all frames (i.e. dividing by the 
  histogram bin volume) was done in the Python scripts, so if it appears 
  that something is missing, keep this in mind.

- The Python programs that handled the full ensemble averages have
  been omitted because they mostly involve file i/o. If you have 
  questions about how to properly wrap the Fortran subroutines into
  a Python program and use these single frame analysis tools for
  ensemble averages over multiple frames, feel free to e-mail me at
  bunne043@umn.edu

- The cluster analysis Python script is dreadfully slow and unorganized.
  I've included it mostly so that people can see how to, for example,
  implement an elliptical H-bond cutoff or generally approach their
  own cluster analysis program. More computationally efficient
  algorithms can almost certainly be found in the literature.

- In general, I hope this repository makes it explicitly clear how
  simulation analysis was handled and aids peers in writing analysis
  codes for open ensembles.
